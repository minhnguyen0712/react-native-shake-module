# react-native-shake-module

Hi, this library is currently in development. You cannot use anything inside this library now. Thanks, developers!

## Current roadmap

This will be my approach to shake module on mobile using React Native.
There are some currently good **shake-module** libraries and feel free to go there to use.

I'll also use this library as a form of **training myself into writing native modules on React Native**.

P/S: You guys can hit on the issues and tell me which features should i developer about shake module. Thanks.

## Getting started

`$ npm install react-native-shake-module --save`

### Mostly automatic installation

`$ react-native link react-native-shake-module`

## Usage

```javascript
import ReactNativeShakeModule from "react-native-shake-module";

// TODO: What to do with the module?
ReactNativeShakeModule;
```
